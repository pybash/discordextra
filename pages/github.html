        <li>To make sure our Discord Extra users can be safe and to know that Discord Extra does not want to do any malicious intent, I had made the source open on GitHub to be <strong>reviewed, forked, and shared</strong> with users.</li>
        <li>The open-source code and the web extension won't have any compromises or hidden features that make both of them different. (Assuming if the repository and extension are on the same update)</li>
        <li>My extension won't use any CSP bypass, and will only communicate within CSP limits.</li>
    </ul>
